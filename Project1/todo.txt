1: Since I can't update html on a servlet like in Angular I will have to make a 
   2nd servlet for listing reimbursements and swap back and forth 
   (maybe use some javascript here?)
   (Could also add buttons to the user servlet and go back and forth probably easiest)

2: add admin functionality

3: styling

4: figure out where I am using javascript and AJAX

5: host on AWS?

6: refactor code
